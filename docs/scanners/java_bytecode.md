# Java Bytecode Crypto Scanner

Parses compiled Java artifacts and extracts crypto algorithm literals from
the class-file constant pool.

## Scope

- `.class` — single class file; reads `CONSTANT_Utf8` entries (JVM §4.4)
- `.jar`, `.war`, `.ear` — ZIP archives; iterates `*.class` entries

## What's detected

Literals passed to JCA APIs remain in the constant pool even after
`javac` compilation and most obfuscators (ProGuard, R8) preserve them
because reflection-based crypto calls (`Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")`)
need the literal at runtime.

Registry covers ~80 entries: JCA standard names, BouncyCastle aliases,
NIST PQC (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, FN-DSA), and provider-identification
strings (BC, BCFIPS, BCPQC).

## Profile + tier

- Comprehensive profile only (heavy — parses every class)
- Pro+ license tier only

## What's NOT detected

- Keys dynamically constructed from `String.concat` / `StringBuilder`
- Algorithm names loaded from runtime config files (those are caught by `config.go`)
- Provider-internal APIs that bypass the JCA layer
- Classes inside encrypted/signed JARs where the attacker stripped the pool
- Manifest metadata (`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` — `Main-Class`, `Class-Path`,
  `Sealed`, signature attributes) is not parsed. Code signing of JARs is
  handled by `codesign_pe_jar.go` (`jarsigner -verify`), not by this
  scanner.
- Dependency JARs nested inside WAR/EAR archives (`WEB-INF/lib/*.jar` are
  not recursively scanned). Spring Boot WARs and Jakarta EE EARs commonly
  pack crypto-carrying libraries like `spring-security-crypto` this way.
  A scan of the outer WAR/EAR will miss those unless they're extracted
  first. Recursive scanning is a planned follow-up.

## Limitations

- Only literal strings are matched. `getInstance(myAlgoVar)` is opaque to
  this scanner and caught (if at all) by source scanning.
- ProGuard's `-repackage` does not affect constant pool literals, so the
  scanner still works on obfuscated JARs.

## Agentless / remote scanning

Not supported. This scanner reads local filesystem files via stdlib
`os.Open` and `archive/zip.OpenReader`, both of which require a local
file descriptor. Agentless (remote) JAR/class scanning requires an
`io.ReaderAt`-capable `FileReader` adapter plus a ZIP decoder that
accepts it — planned as a follow-up. In agentless scans today this
module is effectively a no-op.
